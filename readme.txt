Folders are self-explanatory and programs are in the /bin/debug folders.
I am not sure if this counts as a a deep hierarchy but I thought it would
be best if it were kept in their original positions so that the .sln
project files can safely be opened if need be.

Keep in mind that the form implementation was done first, meaning there are
residual elements from the form that are present in the command-line code.
Each folder has their own read me with descriptions and instructions about use.

The current code was created last minute due to fixed to achieve the expected outcome,
particularly more goals. Therefore, minimum testing was done on the given code.

The 'old', contains code used before more goals were implemented and is safer, 
however only allows two goals.
